# BMP-Conv2D

This project is rather not robust.
It requires modification in source code and rebuild to change input file and output file name.
And also does not handle errors.

## Usage

Make sure you have gcc, make installed on you system.
Modify main.c to adapt to your input BMP file.

``````
make // simply make
./main
``````
